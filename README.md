# Heart Disease Predictor

Healthcare is a major domain where data mining techniques are widely used. If you are curious about data mining projects in healthcare, you should explore the heart disease dataset.
## Dataset

The 'heart.csv' dataset contains 75 particulars of 303 people. These particulars include parameters related to an individual’s heart health like age, gender, serum cholesterol, blood sugar, etc.

## Project Implementation Steps


1) Understand the Dataset Attributes: Familiarize yourself with the attributes and their meanings in the dataset.

2) Data Cleaning: Apply the required data cleaning methods to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

3) Outlier Detection: Detect and handle any outliers present in the dataset.

4) Classification Models: Implement different classification models to investigate the performance of each classifier on heart disease datasets.

5) Observations and Analysis: Mention your observations and study the parameters that play a vital role in determining the health condition of people’s hearts. For example:

   - What percentage of younger people are prone to be diagnosed with heart disease?
   - Are women more prone to heart diseases, or is it the other way?
   - Analyze age-based trends, gender-based trends, etc.

6) Visualization: Visualize the results of data in plots to discover potential insights. Possible plots include:

   - Distribution plots for various attributes.
   - Scatter plots to visualize relationships between different parameters.
   - Bar plots for gender-based analysis, age-based analysis, etc.
